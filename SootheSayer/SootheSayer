The Soothesayer is an evil demon, it looks like a Thylacine, but with humanid features. 
It walks hunched over, with hands like claws, and a long pointed tounge. This creature feeds on the woes of its co-habitants.
The soothesayer uses kind words, and comforting sounds, to manipulate the senses of its victims, 
altering its own apearance, to them, such that it may linger in proximity to those in dispair. 
The Soothesayer is known to eat children, then linger where the child went missing. When scared parents arrive, 
The soothesayer may speak to the parent, in a copasetic maner, and the parent may thusly feel relief. 
The relief victims feel is not true relief, it is the Soothesayer consuming thier dispair. 

The soothesayer may seek to confine itself with those in pain, the elderly, or chronicaly ill, to consume thier ongoing woes. 
but should the victim regain joy, or contentment in thier life, the soothesayer may persue avenues to create more agony and dispair.
The Soothesayer disarms its victims with words, but no mater what, the Soothing effect the Soothesayer provides, is an illusion, 
and life with a soothesayer, can only stay bad, or get worse. 
Victims may describe the Soothesayer to look like thier friend whome they cant recal how they met, another person of the 
same age, a child, or a family friend. 

Soothesayers may be seen as thier native form, by anyone not under the Soothesayers spell. 
Soothesayers have always existed, and will always exist, where ever there is dispair.
